# Bellabeat Case Study
## Google Analytics Certification Course

### This repository houses my case study submission for the google analytics certification course.  The case study was based on a request from the Owner and CEO of Bellabeat for analytics on competitor smart-device utilization trends so they could better formulate a marketting strategy for their own products.

Dataset Descriptions:
#### Source Datasets

[Kaggle Dataset - FitBit](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit)

Data set suggested by Bellabeat Owner - contains two separate directories that have data describing FitBit user activity for March through April, and April through May.  

Metrics include:

* Daily Activity
* Heart Rate
* Hourly Calories
* Hourly Intensities
* Hourly Steps
* Calories burned per minute
* Sleep Minutes
* Weight Logs

[Kaggle Dataset - Human Stress Detection in and Through Sleep](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laavanya/human-stress-detection-in-and-through-sleep)

A case study for a 'Smart Yoga Pillow' product that focused on identifying a relationship between stress and sleep.  It contains a variety of sleep metrics that we could consider for the stakeholders investigation into trends of smart device usage. 

Metrics Include:

* respiration rate
* body temperature
* limb movement rate
* bloood oxygen levels
* eye movement
* number of hours of sleep
* heart rate
* stress levels

[Kaggle Dataset - Apple Health Sleep Stages and Heart Rate ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aeryss/apple-health-sleep-stages-and-heart-rate)

Dataset containing sleep tracking metrics submitted from Apple Watch owners.  The files appear to be split by user and by categories of sleep metric (heart_rate, lables, motion, steps).  

Metrics Include:

* Heart Rate
* Motion
* Steps

[Kaggle Dataset - Health App Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dannyperez014/health-app-data-2017-2024)

Apple's health app data public dataset.  This dataset has a number of aspects associated with health metrics tracked through apples health applications.  

Metrics Include:
* Energy Burned
* Walking Steadiness
* Basal Energy
* Cals
* Dist Walking & Running
* Stairs Climbed
* Headphone Audio
* Sleep Analysis
* Step_counts
* Walking Asymmetry
* Walking Double Support
* Walking Speeds
* Walking Step Lengths

### Reliable data sources of health data from Garner Products, Samsung, or Amazfit were not readily available, so this analysis is based on the provided *fitbit* data from Urska Srsen, data from a 'smart pillow' product case called 'SaYo Pillow' and *Sleep Metric Data* collected from a few smart devices
